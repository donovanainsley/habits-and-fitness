## User Experience (UX)

- ### User Stories

  - **First Time Visitor Goals**

    1.  As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
    1.  As a First Time Visitor, I want to see reviews and testimonials from current clients to know what they think of them and see if they are trusted.

- ### Design

  - #### Colour Scheme

    - The main colours used are white, turquoise and grey with black for some section headings,. This color scheme was provided to me when designing my logo on [logo.com](https://logo.com/), which I decided to keep as I appreciated the aesthetics.

    ![Color Palette](https://github.com/donovanainsley/habits-and-fitness/blob/main/assets/testing/color-palette.png)

  - #### Typography

    - The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the website with Arial as the backup due to it being considered the most web-safe font. I chose Montserrat after Googling the best Google fonts for websites and come across an article by Newbird which can be found [here](https://newbird.com/best-google-fonts-to-use-on-your-website/) where it was selected as the 2nd of the 8 best Google fonts. The 1st best was Merriweather but as this is a Serif style font it may have impacted the site's readability, and this is why I selected Montserrat as it is a Sans-Serif font that provides better readability for the site.

  - #### Imagery

    - Visual elements play a crucial role, especially when there's a captivating jumbotron at the center. The expansive backdrop hero image is carefully crafted to make a bold impact and instantly engage the user. All images used throughout the site were taken from [freepik](https://www.freepik.com/).

### Further Testing

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Macbook Pro, iPad, and Samsung Galaxy S20+.
- Friends and Code Institue peers were asked to review the site to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

- When validating the code for the contact.html, a warning was being pushed as the form didn't have a heading. This was not part of the design for the form so, I provided the form with a heading, giving it the class of "title" then with custom css gave it the property of display: none;. This allowed me to keep the form styled as I wanted but providing good code to show no erros or warnings.
