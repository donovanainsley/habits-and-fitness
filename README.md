-   ### Design ###

    -   #### Colour Scheme

        - The main colours used are white, turquoise and grey with black for some section headings,. This color scheme was provided to me when designing my logo on [here](https://logo.com/).
    
    - #### Typography

        - The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the website with Arial as the backup due to it being considered the most web-safe font. I chose Montserrat after Googling the best Google fonts for websites and come across an article by Newbird which can be found [here](https://newbird.com/best-google-fonts-to-use-on-your-website/) where it was selected as the 2nd of the 8 best Google fonts. The 1st best was Merriweather but as this is a Serif style font it may have impacted the site's readability, and this is why I selected Montserrat as it is a Sans-Serif font that provides better readability for the site.

    - #### Imagery

        - Visual elements play a crucial role, especially when there's a captivating jumbotron at the center. The expansive backdrop hero image is carefully crafted to make a bold impact and instantly engage the user.
